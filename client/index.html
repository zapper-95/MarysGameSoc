				<h1>ALL ARE WELCOME</h1>
			<p>Everyone is welcome at Game Soc!
			Whether you've got over a thousand hours
			on League of Legends or if you've never
			played Monopoly, we are an inclusive space
			within the college to discuss and play our
			favourite games. Look out for more LGBT+
			collaborations, as well as collaborations
			with other societies both at Mary's and
			at other colleges. In our first year we
			actively encouraged members of the MCR
			to participate and are one of the more
			diverse societies when it comes to age!
			Membership is free so long as you have
			paid membership to either the JCR or MCR
			at Mary's.</p>

			<h2>ACHIEVEMENTS</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>In the past, St Mary's Game Soc has:
			Set up the Mary's Minecraft Server (IP
			address can be found on Facebook and
			Discord)
			</li>
			<li>
			Hosted Teikyo 2020 Online (A Tournement
			of Games to see which accommodation
			was best out of Teikyo, Williamson,
			Fergusson and Shepards Wing!)
			</li>
			<li>
			Hosted multiple LGBT+ Game Sessions
			Last year, we managed to hold five in
			person events despite the circumstances
			and we raised over Â£1,100 for the Red
			Cross.
			</li>			
		</ul>

		 We believe that this year we will
		only build on our momentum especially
		since restrictions are easing!

		<h2>THE SESSIONS</h2>

			<p>Game Soc runs regular sessions every
				Saturday 1pm until 5pm in the Fergusson
				JCR. Other sessions will be advertised on
				our Facebook page!
